# deeplearning_midterm_22300130110
The midterm project of deep learning, based on MNIST. The repository provided the operations that the project requested, including a mindspore version CNN model for slow implementation of the original CNN model.
1. In the "dataset" fold, there are the MNIST set(same as the ones that downloaded from the Github link of elearning).
2. In the "saved_models" fold, there contains the weights and accuracy of different models in the "modification_model.pickle" and "modification_model_history.pickle" respectively. The modifications were accumulated according to the questions' sequence of the pj request 1.2 questions.
3. The weight and the accuracy of the models are visiualized in the "visiualized_img" fold.
